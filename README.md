# SusToken

SusToken is a reward token for users and organizations
that perform environmentally friendly and climate-responsible actions.

It was developed as my final project
in [Coinbase's 2023 Base Bootcamp](https://base.mirror.xyz/AwurHvCNqDPQYIs5aabA3DVyfDlC4rE1WBJdKU28a_g)
designed to turn experienced developers into smart contract developers.

# My App

The repository contains all the moving parts of this project:

1. **A Web2 app:** receives proof of responsible actions from the user and allows an admin to
   evaluate those proofsâ€”on approval, users are granted points that can be redeemed via on-chain.
2. **An Oracle:** allows for querying the web2 app to bring off-chain data, on-chain - developed
   with [Airnode](https://www.api3.org/airnode/) and [ChainAPI](https://chainapi.com/)
3. **The smart contracts:** manage requesting user points data and minting tokens to their wallet
   addresses.
